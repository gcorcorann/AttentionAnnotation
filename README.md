# AttentionAnnotation
Video Attentaion Annotation

Before you run the annotation program, make sure you either: (1) do not have an
"annotations.txt" file in the program folder, or (2) the "annotations.txt" file
is empty.
Assuming these conditions, you need to run 'make && ./annotate' and this will
compile and run the program.
